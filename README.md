# Website Password Changer

A Keepass plugin that automates password changes on websites, because we're all lazy.

-----

Passwords for important accounts should be changed once or twice a year;
and definitely whenever you suspect they're compromised.

Changing passwords can be tiresome, though. You have to,

1. Recall your current password
1. Log in to the site
1. Think of a new password
1. Change your password
1. Remember your new password

This gets harder when password requirements get complex, or long.

Website Password Changer (WPC) is a Keepass plugin that helps you do
all of the above, with a few simple clicks.

change your passwords when you need to.

### What is Keepass?

Many people use the built-in password managers of Chrome, and Firefox, to
manage their list of sites, and passwords.

However, these password managers are simple; nothing more than data stores.

Keepass is a feature-rich, and highly customizable password manager;
for those that want more control over their security.
